Article from a human psychology/neuroscience perspective:

Unconsciousness information we have no metaknowledge about

We are typically conscious about the information that we hold.

Persaud et al. introduced a measure of awareness: Post-Decision Wagering (PDW), wherein participants continuously evaluate their performance.

PDW logic:  should bet high for correct decisions, low for errors.

Goals of paper: What computational principles are required for this metaknowledge to occur?

Assumptions: evaluation of performance requires first-order representations that are responsible for performance to be accessed in a way different from their expression.

Most systems are not aware of the information that they hold, knowledge in the system must become knowledge for the system.

Second order network needed to determine performance of first network.

Structure of network: 3 layer backpropagation feedforward first-order network to perform first task.

First order network: used winner-take-all algorithm (output from 0 to 1)

w_fg & w_gh = [-1, 1]

f vector: 100x1, fixed weight = 1.0 to 2nd level network

g vector: hidden input layer, 60x1, no weights to 2nd level network

h vector: output layer, 100x1 with weight -1.0, 

w_co (comparator units for second order network to obtain wager) [0, .1]

fixed weights are passed to second order network

f-h = c, size 100x1 (this is second order network)

o is output, size 2x1 is final wager

First order network (FON):

patterns:
1.) stimulus: vector with 100 elements, 99 with range [0 0.2], rand
2.) noise: vector with 100 elements, range [0 0.02], rand
pretraining 
1.) vector with 100 elements stimulus 
2.) noise with 100 elements  //150 epoch, n = 0.9, momentum = 0.0, temperature = 1
target: stimulus 99[0]
present: 1[1]

stimulus: 99 [0]
1 [1]

stimulus absent: 100[0.0]

Discrimination threshold:
at least one unit > 0.5

SON:

target:
high wager = 1.0
low = 0.0
if 1.) FON localiazed stimulus && stimulus was presented, OR
2.)FON did not localize stimulus && stimulus not presented 
high confidence

2.) high 0.0
low = 1.0
for low confidenece
