# NEURAL_NETWORKS

Final project for PSYCH186B at UCLA, Neural Networks

Authors: Jia Hui Ma and Sivananda Rajananda

This project is intended to be a qualitatively replication and possible extension of a metacognitive neural network.

Goals: To qualitatively replicate and understand the simulations produced in "Simulations based on "Know thyself: Metacognitive networks and measures of consciousness" by Antoine Pasquali, Bert Timermans, Axel Cleeremans (2010).

Goal 1A: Attempt at replicating Simulation 1 with our own code.
